# Choose a skill for the job

Use this guide to choose a skill for a task, if one is needed. It follows [Decisions §6](../DECISIONS_AI_TOOLING.md#6-skills). For host setup and a project verifier, use [Start a new repo with the selected pstack skills](poteto-workflow.md). The implementation, prototype, and maintenance routes below use that verifier.

Choose the route your task needs. Skip the rest.

Invoke the skill in your prompt. Pstack skills and Matt's `to-spec` and `to-tickets` are manual-only. OMP hides manual skills from automatic discovery but loads them by name. Invoking a recipe authorizes its named dependencies; reading a skill to check discovery does not invoke it.

## Find the route

| Situation | Route |
|---|---|
| A small change you already understand | Implement it directly and exercise the affected path |
| A report you cannot restate yet | A plain-English restatement before any fix |
| How the current code works | `/how` |
| Why the code has its current shape | `/why`, scoped to one target and question |
| You want the agent to explain its work and reasoning | `/teach` |
| You are resuming earlier work in this workspace | `/recall` |
| Goals, constraints, or choices only a person can make | `/grilling` |
| An unknown that an experiment can measure | `/prototype`, with the verifier |
| A new interface that callers will use | `/technical-writing` and `/codebase-design` |
| A consequential doubt that evidence supports | `/interrogate` |
| A settled design needs coordination across sessions or people | `/to-spec` or `/to-tickets` |
| Proof that a change works | The project verifier, on the affected paths |
| The verifier no longer matches the app | `/maintain-verification-skill`, on every mapped feature |

## Make small, understood changes directly

For a small change you already understand, implement it and exercise the affected user path with the project verifier. Show the evidence. Skip the planning document, interview, and critique.

## Restate an ambiguous report before fixing it

Ask the agent to explain an unclear report before proposing a fix:

```text
Read this report and restate the underlying problem in plain English.
Separate observations from assumptions. Do not prescribe a fix yet.
```

## Use explanation skills only for their own questions

Choose the skill that answers your question.

`/how` explains the current mechanism: what runs, where, and in what order.

```text
/how does [feature] handle [case]? Point to the relevant code and explain
it briefly. Do not change anything.
```

`/why` investigates why the code has its current shape. It searches broadly by default. For everyday use, specify one target, one question, and a source scope. The prompt below starts with Git history and project documents, widening only to authorized sources if the question remains open. It is read-only and reports unsearched or unreachable sources as coverage limits.

```text
/why does [module] [behavior]? Start with Git history and project documents.
Widen only to sources I have authorized, and list any evidence you could
not reach.
```

`/teach` explains how engineering work functions and why it was done that way. It uses `/how` and `/why`, separates evidence from inference, and states uncertainty. Diagrams use a format the session can render, such as Mermaid or plain text; image generation requires an available tool. It does not change code or create a course or learning workspace.

```text
/teach me why you implemented [change] this way and not [alternative].
What tradeoffs did you make, and which parts did you verify?
```

`/recall` reconstructs recent work from this workspace's session history and shared project record. Skip it when there is no relevant history.

```text
/recall my work on [topic] in this repository over the last 7 days.
Check the current state before recommending the next action.
```

## Settle human goals with grilling

Use `/grilling` to settle goals, constraints, or tradeoffs that require your choice before design begins. Use experiments for measurable questions rather than repeating interviews about an abstract plan.

## Measure unknowns with a prototype

Use a prototype to answer a measurable question about an interaction, state model, or layout:

```text
/prototype the unresolved [interaction or state-model question].
Use /[verifier] where applicable to exercise the result and capture evidence.
Compare the alternatives against the question. Stop before production
implementation so I can choose.
```

## Design a new interface from the caller's side

For a new module or API, describe how callers will use it before writing the implementation:

```text
Use /technical-writing to draft a short tutorial showing how a caller
would use [module]. Apply /unslop. Use /codebase-design to assess the
interface and its tradeoffs. Stop before implementation.
```

## Reserve interrogate for consequential uncertainty

`/interrogate` runs several models against one frozen snapshot and returns a report. Use it when a mistake would be expensive to undo and specific evidence still leaves doubt. Include that evidence in the prompt. Use `code-review` for routine review; do not interrogate an abstract plan.

## Plan durable work after the design settles

Use `/to-spec` or `/to-tickets` after the design settles, when work needs coordination across sessions or people. Each slice must name a live verification action and its expected result. Both skills end with publication. Require a separate approval before the agent publishes.

```text
/to-tickets for the settled [design]. In each ticket, name the /[verifier]
action and the observable result that proves it. Show me the tickets and
do not publish them until I approve.
```

## Verify affected paths, and maintain the whole map separately

For an ordinary change, verify the affected paths. Do not run full maintenance for every change.

Invoke `/maintain-verification-skill` separately. It checks the feature map against the source, exercises every mapped feature, fixes verifier drift, and reports product regressions separately. See [Keep the verifier useful](poteto-workflow.md#4-keep-the-verifier-useful) for the prompt.

## Methods this stack does not include

This stack excludes `/poteto-mode`, `/architect`, and `/swarm`. For planning, use the routes above rather than the articles' `/poteto-mode`. Local subagents do not replace `swarm` coverage.
