# Agentic environment tools

This folder packages commands that provision and update a local multi-agent tooling stack.

Docs:
- [Project memory stack](docs/project-memory-stack.md) – guide and one-repo template for `codebase-memory-mcp`, `agentmemory`, `CONTEXT.md`, and ADR usage.
- [Decisions](DECISIONS_AI_TOOLING.md) – the operative stack contract, one section per layer (Decided → Why → Rejected → Revisit → Wiring); `lean-ctx` was removed stack-wide (ADR-0009).

- `agentic-install-agents`
  - Installs/reinstalls:
    - Hermes Agent (`hermes`)
    - OMP / Oh My Pi (`omp`)
    - OpenAI Codex CLI (`codex`)
    - Claude Code (`claude`)
- `agentic-install-skills-mcps`
  - Installs:
    - mattpocock skills pack (global)
    - ponytail skill bundle (global, agent-dispatch)
    - `codebase-memory-mcp` (UI install supported)
    - `agentmemory` (CLI + Hermes MCP config)
  - Skill packs are driven by the bundled `agentic_env/skill-packs.json` default with:
    - `packs` entries whose `source` is `owner/repo#<tag>` (pinned; `skills add` clones that tag) and which can define optional `skills` (array of specific skill names)
      to install only those from that pack by default. `cursor/plugins` (pstack) publishes no tags and floats on `main`.
    - `profiles` (named pack sets).
  - Supported options:
    - `--skill-pack` (comma-separated, repeated) to choose packs.
    - `--skill` (comma-separated, repeated; filters each selected pack).
    - `--skill-agent` (comma-separated, repeated; defaults to `hermes,claude,codex`).
    - `--skill-profile` (for example: `default`, `minimal`, `agentic-only`).
    - `--skill-config PATH` to use a custom skill-pack config.
    - `--all-skills` to install every configured pack.
  - Example:
    - `agentic-install-skills-mcps --all-skills --skill-agent hermes,claude,codex --yes`
  - Skill config JSON keeps the same shape as the bundled default.
    - Packs without `skills` install full pack contents by default.
    - When `skills` exists and you pass `--skill`, installs the intersection of both lists.
- `agentic-configure-agent-mcps`
  - Adds selected project-memory MCP servers when missing:
    - Hermes: `codebase-memory-mcp` and `agentmemory`
      - Accepts scalar block lists, including Hermes/PyYAML's indentless style. List mappings, nested lists, and unsupported list syntax are rejected without writing. When entries are added, the writer preserves scalar types and empty mappings but normalizes formatting and drops comments.
    - OMP: `codebase-memory-mcp` only, written gated (kept in `disabledServers`, enable per session); `agentmemory` and `lean-ctx` are excluded — stale entries are removed and both names stay in `disabledServers` so OMP's `~/.claude.json` import cannot mount them (ADR-0006/ADR-0009)
  - Existing selected MCP entries are validated, not repaired: a mismatched command, arguments, or Hermes memory provider is reported for manual correction and fails configuration without rewriting that file. Missing entries are added only when the file is otherwise valid; unrelated settings are preserved.
  - Adds matching global skills, with the same OMP exclusions.
  - Seeds `~/.omp/agent/config.yml` from the stack contract when absent (mnemopi memory, compaction handoff @ 150K, verification/canary hook extensions, `enableClaudeUser: true` + `enableAgentsUser: false`); when present, verifies the contract settings and reports drift without rewriting user YAML.
- `agentic-bootstrap`
  - One-shot onboarding in phase order:
    - installs agent CLIs
    - installs MCP tooling and matching skills
    - configures MCP servers and global skills
    - runs `agentic-stack-doctor` (a mandatory-check failure fails the bootstrap)
  - defaults:
    - `--skill-profile default`
    - all install/configure targets
    - non-interactive execution with phase `--yes` flags
  - split execution with:
    - `--skip-install-agents`
    - `--skip-install-skills`
    - `--skip-configure`
    - `--skip-doctor`
    - `--configure-no-skills`
- `agentic-update-stack`
  - Converges installed components to the reviewed versions in `agentic_env/stack_metadata.py` without interactive prompts:
    - `hermes`, `omp`, `codex`, `claude`, `skills` CLI, `codebase-memory-mcp`, `agentmemory` CLI
  - Ends with `agentic-stack-doctor`; a mandatory-check failure makes the update exit non-zero.
  - Does not self-update `agentic-env`; use `uv tool upgrade agentic-env`.
- `agentic-stack-doctor`
  - Read-only diagnosis of the stack contract. Mandatory = the OMP layer (binaries, both `mcp.json` roots wired + gated incl. the `node_repl` built-in, excluded servers absent there and in `~/.claude.json`, no read-interception prose incl. `~/.claude.json`, `config.yml` contract, hooks registered once and present, curated skill roster, no `lean-ctx` skill dir). Hermes wiring (incl. a stale `lean-ctx` entry) and secondary-agent binaries only warn (`TODO secondary`). Exit 1 only on a mandatory failure; prints corrective guidance per failure; never repairs.
  - Checks actual managed MCP definitions and the compaction method order (`handoff`, `remote`, `soft`), not just entry names. Existing definition mismatches require manual correction; rerunning the add-missing-only configurator does not repair them.
- Checkout development runs the package modules through `uv run python -m agentic_env.<module>`; installed workflows use the `agentic-*` commands.
- `setup_helpers.sh`
  - Shared quiet/verbose `run_cmd` helper used by shell setup scripts and the Docker smoke test.

## Quick usage

Install the command set from this checkout:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/dotfiles/agentic-env
uv tool install --force .
agentic-bootstrap
agentic-update-stack

# Split steps (legacy):
# agentic-install-agents --all --yes
# agentic-install-skills-mcps --all-mcps --yes
# agentic-configure-agent-mcps --yes
```

Run package modules directly when developing from the checkout:

```bash
uv run python -m agentic_env.bootstrap
uv run python -m agentic_env.install_agents
uv run python -m agentic_env.install_skills_mcps
uv run python -m agentic_env.configure_agent_mcps
uv run python -m agentic_env.update_agentic_stack
uv run python -m agentic_env.stack_doctor
```

### Update policy

`agentic-update-stack` is an unattended convergence command, not a latest-version updater.

- Install and update use the same immutable commit, release, or npm package pins from `agentic_env/stack_metadata.py`.
- Every changed component is checked with its version command; a mismatch fails the run.
- Exception: a Hermes checkout already *ahead* of `HERMES_COMMIT` is left alone (the Hermes installer refuses to roll an install backwards; drift above the pin is tolerated). The doctor still warns until the pin catches up.
- Upgrading the curated stack requires a reviewed metadata, installer checksum, and release-asset checksum change.
- `skills` refers to the pinned CLI only; installed skill-pack contents are not advanced to floating upstream revisions.
- Do not call `agentmemory upgrade` here. That command prompts to re-run the `iii-engine` installer and can mutate the current workspace when `package.json` is present. Run it manually when intentionally refreshing the `iii-engine` runtime.


## Runbooks


### 1) Smoke validate from scratch (recommended)

```bash
cd /path/to/your/dotfiles/agentic-env
docker compose up --build --force-recreate --exit-code-from fresh-install fresh-install
```

`--force-recreate` matters: otherwise Compose restarts the previous container with its retained installation. Acceptance runs as an ordinary user in an isolated HOME, with a user-writable npm prefix and the checkout mounted read-only. No provider credentials are required.

For Arch Linux x86_64:

```bash
docker compose --profile arch up --build --force-recreate --exit-code-from fresh-install-arch fresh-install-arch
```

What this runbook validates:
- installs from clean container
- verifies `hermes`, `omp`, `codex`, `claude`, `codebase-memory-mcp`, `agentmemory` are callable
- runs `agentic-stack-doctor` (OMP mandatory contract) and checks Hermes MCP/skill artifacts

### 2) Interactive container validation (same checkbook, inspectable)

```bash
cd /path/to/your/dotfiles/agentic-env
docker compose run --rm --entrypoint sh fresh-install
```

This starts a fresh image, not a provisioned stack. Inside that same container:

```sh
sh ./clean-acceptance.sh
# Recheck the retained installation without installing again:
SKIP_INSTALL=1 sh ./clean-acceptance.sh
```

The wrapper prints its isolated HOME. Exiting the `--rm` container discards it.

### 3) Host-side install + configure smoke (no docker)

If you need to run on the host machine directly:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/dotfiles/agentic-env
uv tool install --force .
agentic-bootstrap
agentic-stack-doctor
agentmemory doctor
codebase-memory-mcp --version
hermes --help
omp --help
```

Use `SKIP_INSTALL=1 sh ./docker-smoke-test.sh` for strict checks against this already-provisioned host. For native acceptance without using existing workstation configuration, use the isolated macOS procedure below.


### 4) Check MCP visibility inside Hermes

In a working Hermes install:

```bash
hermes mcp list
```

If you see the two entries below, they are wired:
- `agentmemory` (transport: `npx`)
- `codebase-memory-mcp` (transport: `codebase-memory-mcp`)

Functional checks:

```bash
hermes mcp test agentmemory
hermes mcp test codebase-memory-mcp
```

If configuration reports malformed YAML or an existing MCP definition mismatch, correct the named fields in `~/.hermes/config.yaml` manually. The expected commands and pinned arguments are defined by `MCP_SERVERS` in `agentic_env/configure_agent_mcps.py`; the configurator does not repair existing entries.

To explicitly select the memory provider and then add any missing entries:

```bash
hermes config set memory.provider agentmemory
agentic-configure-agent-mcps --yes --server codebase-memory-mcp --server agentmemory --agent hermes
```

Then rerun `hermes mcp list`.


### 5) Existing-project onboarding (no full fresh bootstrap)

From an already-installed machine/CI agent environment, wire the memory MCPs in-place:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/dotfiles/agentic-env
agentic-install-skills-mcps --all-skills --all-mcps --yes
agentic-configure-agent-mcps --yes
```

Then from any repo:

```bash
hermes mcp list
hermes mcp test agentmemory
hermes mcp test codebase-memory-mcp
```

Ponytail (`ponytail`) is installed as a **global, language-agnostic skill bundle** via
`agentic-install-skills-mcps` and is available to all supported harnesses that read user
global skills.

## Clean-platform acceptance

Files:
- `Dockerfile.agentic` – Debian bookworm prerequisites
- `Dockerfile.arch` – Arch Linux rolling prerequisites
- `docker-compose.yml` – ordinary-user container runs with a read-only checkout
- `clean-acceptance.sh` – isolated HOME, PATH, npm/uv/XDG state, and clean preconditions
- `docker-smoke-test.sh` – shared installation and verification contract
- `.dockerignore` – trims compose build context for faster local/CI builds


### Verified acceptance

[Run 34526778331](https://github.com/MihaiA24/.dotfiles/actions/runs/34526778331) passed on 2026-09-10 at code commit [`2cb1f08f9d0a7538ecef12e7532dfaee554a6400`](https://github.com/MihaiA24/.dotfiles/commit/2cb1f08f9d0a7538ecef12e7532dfaee554a6400). Each job provisioned an empty, isolated HOME as an ordinary user, then repeated the complete checks with `SKIP_INSTALL=1` against the retained installation.

| Recorded environment | Architecture | Fresh install | Checks-only |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Native macOS 15.7.9, build 24G830 | arm64 | Passed | Passed |
| Arch Linux rolling container, `VERSION_ID=20260906.0.587075` | x86_64 | Passed | Passed |
| Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm) container | x86_64 | Passed | Passed |

Both Linux containers used the Ubuntu runner's `6.17.0-1022-azure` kernel; this is distro-userland evidence, not native distro-boot evidence. Direct CachyOS verification remains deferred. Intel macOS is outside acceptance scope. Reviewed component versions and installer checksums were unchanged.

### CI contract

`.github/workflows/agentic-env-smoke-test.yml` defines:

| Environment | Execution | Coverage |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Debian bookworm x86_64 | `node:20-bookworm-slim` container on Ubuntu | Existing Linux baseline |
| macOS 15 arm64 | Native `macos-15` GitHub runner | Apple Silicon only |
| Arch Linux x86_64 | Official `archlinux:base` container on Ubuntu | Arch-family proxy, not direct CachyOS verification |

Push and pull-request triggers cover `agentic-env/**`, `omp/hooks/**`, and the workflow itself. `workflow_dispatch` remains available through **Actions → Agentic env smoke test → Run workflow**. Every job runs the same smoke contract twice: a fresh installation, then checks-only against that retained installation; a failed check fails its job.

Prerequisites are prepared before provisioning: Python 3.12+, Node.js 20+/npm, uv, curl, git, CA certificates, shell/archive utilities, and C/C++ build tools. Arch uses `pacman -Syu` because it is rolling. Containers require Docker Engine and Compose with amd64 support (native or emulated). Native macOS requires working Command Line Tools/Xcode.

The wrapper rejects root, the caller's real HOME, nonempty fresh acceptance directories, and preexisting agent commands. It clears inherited credentials/configuration, redirects user installation and cache paths, and uses hook resources from the checkout through `AGENTIC_DOTFILES_ROOT`. OS release, architecture, revision, run identity, and component versions are printed in the job log. No provider API key is required.

### Run full fresh install test

Use the Debian or Arch commands in Runbook 1 above. Both force a new container; neither relies on an already-installed stack.

### Run native Apple Silicon acceptance

On a macOS arm64 machine with Homebrew and working Command Line Tools:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/dotfiles/agentic-env
test "$(uname -m)" = arm64
brew install uv python@3.12 node@20 xz ca-certificates
export AGENTIC_PREREQ_PATH="$(brew --prefix uv)/bin:$(brew --prefix python@3.12)/libexec/bin:$(brew --prefix node@20)/bin:$(brew --prefix xz)/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"
export AGENTIC_SMOKE_HOME="$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/agentic-env-acceptance.XXXXXX")"
sh ./clean-acceptance.sh
# Same HOME and prerequisite PATH, no reinstall:
SKIP_INSTALL=1 sh ./clean-acceptance.sh
```

The acceptance HOME is retained for inspection/checks-only. Start another fresh acceptance run with a new empty directory. The hosted job prepares Python, Node, and uv with their setup actions instead of Homebrew; it asserts native arm64 before provisioning.

### Run checks only (skip installs)

Checks-only needs the **same already-provisioned environment**. It cannot validate an installation discarded by container recreation. For a retained Debian container:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/dotfiles/agentic-env
docker compose run --build -d --name agentic-env-debian fresh-install sleep infinity
docker exec agentic-env-debian /bin/sh ./clean-acceptance.sh
docker exec -e SKIP_INSTALL=1 agentic-env-debian /bin/sh ./clean-acceptance.sh
# Remove only this disposable acceptance container when finished:
docker rm -f agentic-env-debian
```

For Arch, use `docker compose --profile arch run --build -d --name agentic-env-arch fresh-install-arch sleep infinity`, then the same `docker exec` commands with `agentic-env-arch`. Compose forwards `SKIP_INSTALL`, but setting it while creating a fresh container is not valid checks-only evidence.

### Current smoke contract
The run is successful only if all checks pass:
1. `uv tool install --force .` succeeds using the absolute prerequisite Python path captured before bootstrap.
2. `agentic-bootstrap` succeeds (its final phase is `agentic-stack-doctor`).
3. All six package module entry points load and expose help through `uv run --frozen ... python -m agentic_env.<module> --help`, using that same interpreter rather than Hermes' managed Python 3.11.
4. Binary checks pass for:
   - `agentic-*` entry points incl. `agentic-stack-doctor`
   - `hermes`, `omp`, `codex`, `claude`, `codebase-memory-mcp`, `agentmemory`
5. `agentic-stack-doctor` exits 0 — the OMP mandatory contract:
   - `~/.omp/agent/mcp.json` and `~/.pi/agent/mcp.json` contain the reviewed `codebase-memory-mcp` command/arguments, gated in `disabledServers` together with the `node_repl` built-in; `agentmemory` and `lean-ctx` are absent from `mcpServers` (also in `~/.claude.json`) and remain disabled on both OMP roots
   - no read-interception prose in the OMP MCP files or `~/.claude.json`
   - `~/.omp/agent/config.yml` matches the contract, including compaction method order `handoff`, `remote`, `soft`; each hook is registered once with its file present
   - curated `default` skill roster present; `codebase-memory-mcp` and `ponytail` descriptors in the OMP skill roots; no `lean-ctx` skill dir
6. Hermes config checks pass:
   - `~/.hermes/config.yaml` contains the reviewed commands and arguments for `codebase-memory-mcp` and `agentmemory`, plus `memory.provider: agentmemory` (a stale `lean-ctx` entry is a doctor warning, not a smoke failure)
   - matching `codebase-memory-mcp`, `agentmemory`, and `ponytail` descriptors exist under `~/.hermes/skills`; missing descriptors fail smoke even though the doctor only warns
7. The pinned skills CLI reports the reviewed version through `npx --yes skills@<reviewed-version> --version`; fresh provisioning does not require a global `skills` binary.

## Design and tradeoffs
- **Container bases:** `node:20-bookworm-slim` for the Debian baseline and official `archlinux:base` for rolling Arch x86_64; macOS acceptance executes natively.
- **Measured image size:** about **329MB** for `agentic-env-fresh-install` on the earlier `bullseye-slim` base; not re-measured after the bookworm switch.
- `.dockerignore` in `agentic-env/` trims compose build context for faster local/CI builds.
- `node:20-bullseye-slim` was the original minimum; the image moved to `bookworm-slim` in `b49fa8f` when it gained `xz-utils`/`libatomic1`/`unzip` for Hermes' Node 26 + bun runtime (ADR-0001 records the bullseye-era measurements).
- `alpine` images were rejected due installer/runtime incompatibilities (`omp`/Hermes path).
## Dependencies
- `rich` is required and is installed automatically as a package dependency.
