# Agentic environment tools

Install and maintain an OMP-primary, Hermes-secondary stack.

- [Decisions](DECISIONS_AI_TOOLING.md): operative policy and wiring.
- [Stack overview](docs/stack-overview.md): architecture and research index.
- [Project memory](docs/project-memory-stack.md): per-repo setup.
- [pstack workflow](guides/poteto-workflow.md): prepare a repository's verifier and use it on changes.
- [Skill routing](guides/skill-routing.md): choose a skill for the task.

## Quick usage

The full stack targets macOS/Linux and requires Python 3.12+, Node.js 20+/npm, uv, curl, git, CA certificates, shell/archive utilities, C/C++ build tools and the dotfiles checkout. For Windows or an offline copy, the [Python-only copier](#python-only-copy-on-windows) needs only Python and the checkout.

```bash
cd /path/to/your/dotfiles/agentic-env
uv tool install --force .
agentic-bootstrap
agentic-stack-doctor
```

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `agentic-bootstrap` | Install agents, skills/MCPs, configure, then run doctor |
| `agentic-install-agents` | Install Hermes, OMP, Codex and Claude Code |
| `agentic-install-skills-mcps` | Install selected skills and MCP tooling |
| `agentic-configure-agent-mcps` | Add missing managed entries; report existing drift |
| `agentic-update-stack` | Refresh components, then run doctor; does not update this package |
| `agentic-stack-doctor` | Read-only diagnosis; OMP failures exit 1, secondary/Hermes failures warn |
| `agentic-skill-drift` | Read-only: compare curated skills against their pack sources and upstreams |

Use each command's `--help` for options. Update this package with `uv tool upgrade agentic-env`.

Without selection flags on a terminal, `agentic-install-agents` and `agentic-install-skills-mcps` open checkbox pickers. Space toggles a row, `a` toggles all, `i` inverts, enter confirms. The skills run asks for skills, then a destination: supported harnesses or **Other / custom directory**. Supported harnesses lead to the agent and MCP pickers; a custom directory asks for the exact skills-folder path and skips MCP installation. Both paths print the selection and replay command, then ask for confirmation.

`--yes` takes the flags as given without prompting, and a run without a terminal needs flags because no picker can open. `agentic-bootstrap --interactive` lets its two install phases prompt instead of installing every CLI and the `--skill-profile` packs.

### Skills

#### Choose an installation path

| Need | Route | Requirements and scope |
|---|---|---|
| Provision the full agent stack | [Quick usage](#quick-usage) | macOS/Linux prerequisites above; installs agents and manages configuration |
| Refresh managed OMP/Hermes/Claude/Codex skills | [Managed refresh](#refresh-skills-on-an-existing-omp-host) | Management CLI and native skills CLI/npm; selected agent directories |
| Copy any curated pack into another harness's folder | [Custom directory](#install-into-another-harnesss-directory) | macOS/Linux, Python 3.12+, uv, Node.js/npm and Git; network for remote packs |
| Copy vendored skills on Windows or offline | [Python-only copy](#python-only-copy-on-windows) | Python 3.12+ and a complete checkout; no other runtime dependencies |

Windows acceptance covers only the Python-only copier, not full-stack provisioning or the native skills CLI path. Copying a package does not adapt its instructions or scripts to another harness or OS.

For the managed skill store, the complete curated selection is:

```bash
agentic-install-skills-mcps --skill-profile default --yes
```

[The manifest](agentic_env/skill-packs.json) selects 38 skills. Use `--skill-pack` to select packs, `--skill` to filter their selected names, and `--skill-agent` to override the default `hermes,claude,codex` targets. `--skill-config` supplies a manifest with the same shape; a pack without a `skills` list installs all its contents.

The skills picker lists one row per skill under its pack heading, plus an `All of <pack>` row that takes the whole roster. The `default` profile pre-checks the pack rows; `--skill NAME` pre-checks those skill rows instead. A manifest `skills` entry is either a name or `{"name": ..., "description": ...}`, and the description shows under the list while that row is pointed at. `--mcp` installs a single MCP server (`codebase-memory-mcp` or `agentmemory`); `--all-mcps` installs both.

[Decisions §6](DECISIONS_AI_TOOLING.md#6-skills) owns routing, invocation, review scope and Hermes limitations. Complete Matt/pstack packages are vendored; their `UPSTREAM.md` files record sources and adaptations.

#### Install into another harness's directory

`--skills-dir PATH` copies complete selected packages into `PATH/<skill>/SKILL.md`, including their scripts and references. `PATH` is the skills folder, not the project root. No OMP/Hermes installation is required, but this route still uses the native skills CLI/npm even for vendored-only selections. Use the Python-only route below when those dependencies are unavailable.

Run `uv run agentic-install-skills-mcps` from this checkout for the full guided journey: choose skills, select **Other / custom directory**, enter the path, then review and confirm. Choose **Supported harnesses** instead to keep the existing managed-agent installation. Ctrl-C at either destination prompt cancels without installing anything.

From this checkout, without replacing the host's installed management CLI:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/dotfiles/agentic-env

# Skip the destination prompts; still choose skills interactively.
uv run agentic-install-skills-mcps --skills-dir "/path/to/project/.devin/skills"

# All 38 curated skills without prompts.
uv run agentic-install-skills-mcps \
  --skills-dir "/path/to/project/.devin/skills" --skill-profile default --yes

# Or a subset, in any directory you choose.
uv run agentic-install-skills-mcps \
  --skills-dir "/path/to/custom skills" --skill-pack mattpocock --skill tdd,code-review --yes
```

Choose **one** installation command above. The normal `--skill-pack`, `--skill-profile`, `--skill`, and `--skill-config` selectors still apply. Directory mode writes the selected destination rather than selecting agent roots, installs no MCPs, and does not register global provenance; combining it with `--skill-agent`, `--mcp`, or `--all-mcps` is an error. Without a terminal, provide selection flags.

These are standalone copies, not links or managed installations. Follow the shared [verification and refresh procedure](#verify-and-refresh-standalone-copies) after copying.

The example uses Devin for Terminal's `.devin/skills` layout. Set the directory your harness actually discovers. Skill bodies remain unchanged: OMP/Hermes-specific tools and delegation instructions may need adaptation, and copying them does not verify execution in another harness.

#### Python-only copy on Windows

This standalone fallback requires only Python 3.12+ and the checkout: no uv, npm, third-party Python packages, downloads, agent installation or MCP configuration. It runs without prompts.

Use a complete checkout or an extracted repository ZIP containing the copier, `skill-packs.json`, and the vendored directories together. Downloading the Python file alone is insufficient; Git is not required to run an already available copy.

From the dotfiles checkout root, confirm the interpreter is 3.12 or newer:

```powershell
py -3 --version
```

If the Windows `py` launcher is absent but Python is installed, substitute `python` after checking `python --version`. Choose the exact folder your harness discovers, outside the source skill packages, then run one of these commands:

```powershell
# From the dotfiles checkout; choose ONE command.
py -3 agentic-env\agentic_env\copy_skills.py --skills-dir "C:\work\project\.devin\skills"

# Or copy only these vendored skills.
py -3 agentic-env\agentic_env\copy_skills.py --skills-dir "C:\work\project\.devin\skills" --skill "tdd,code-review"
```

On macOS/Linux, the equivalent command from the checkout root is:

```bash
python3 agentic-env/agentic_env/copy_skills.py --skills-dir "/path/to/project/.devin/skills"
```

By default it copies the **30 vendored Matt/pstack skills**, including scripts and references, and lists the **8 remote-only caveman/ponytail skills it did not copy**. The existing manifest owns this roster. `--skill` accepts comma-separated or repeated names; requesting an unavailable name or passing an empty `--skill` is an error, not permission to copy a different selection.

The copier accepts `--skills-dir` and `--skill`, plus `--help`. Pack/profile/custom-manifest selectors, `--yes`, agent targets and MCP flags belong to the other installer and are not supported here. The successful copy message and exit status 0 are the completion signal; in PowerShell, inspect `$LASTEXITCODE` immediately after the command.

This is file copying only: Bash assets and OMP/Hermes-specific instructions are not converted into Windows-compatible workflows. Use the procedure below to verify the destination and refresh safely.

#### Verify and refresh standalone copies

This procedure covers both custom-directory routes, not the managed-agent refresh below.

1. **Check the result.** Require exit status 0. Confirm the selected names have `PATH/<skill>/SKILL.md` and their scripts/references. A default Python-only copy intentionally excludes the eight remote-only skills; an explicitly requested unavailable skill fails before copying.
2. **Check harness discovery separately.** Use the destination harness's documented skills folder and load one selected skill by name without executing its recipe. File copying proves neither discovery nor workflow compatibility; doctor and `agentic-skill-drift` inspect the managed stack, not an arbitrary destination.
3. **Refresh into a new directory.** Obtain the reviewed checkout/manifest version you intend to use, retain its revision or archive identity and your selection, then rerun the same route with a new destination. Compare whole package directories, preserve local edits and back up the existing selected packages before deliberately replacing them. `uv tool upgrade agentic-env` and `agentic-update-stack` do not refresh standalone copies.
4. **Handle errors without overwriting.** Existing skill names—including dangling symlinks—are refused before any package is copied; unrelated files are retained. Choose a fresh destination rather than deleting local work. Filesystem failures during copying can leave incomplete new packages: inspect the failed destination and retry into a new one after fixing the error; failure is not an atomic rollback.

There is no force-overwrite, automatic merge, uninstall or rollback command for standalone copies. To remove one later, remove only the package directories you copied after preserving local changes; keep unrelated files.

#### Refresh skills on an existing OMP host

Use this runbook when OMP already runs on the host. It refreshes the management CLI and selected skills, not agent binaries or MCP configuration; full bootstrap is unnecessary. Review and preserve intentional edits to installed skills before replacing them.

1. **Refresh the management CLI from the checkout.** This picks up the checkout's manifest, vendored adaptations and guided installer; an older installed CLI may not have the current picker.

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/dotfiles/agentic-env
   uv tool install --force .
   ```

2. **Check OMP discovery.** Its `~/.omp/agent/config.yml` should contain the following settings. Merge missing fields into the existing `skills` mapping; do not replace the whole configuration. Existing settings are user-owned, so the configurator reports drift rather than silently repairing them.

   ```yaml
   skills:
     enableClaudeUser: true
     enableAgentsUser: false
   ```

   OMP reads `~/.claude/skills`, whose links point into the canonical `~/.agents/skills` store. There is no `--skill-agent omp`: keep the default `hermes,claude,codex` targets, or select both Claude and Codex. Claude provides OMP's discovery path; Codex populates the canonical store. Claude-only installation creates copies instead, so it does not establish this layout on a fresh store. Running Claude Code is not required.

3. **Choose one installation path.**

   Guided selection on a terminal:

   ```bash
   agentic-install-skills-mcps
   ```

   Select individual skills or pack rows, choose **Supported harnesses**, keep the targets described above, and **clear every MCP row** for a skills-only refresh. **Other / custom directory** produces standalone copies instead of refreshing the managed OMP layout. Review the printed selection and replay command before confirming; decline the final confirmation to leave the selection uninstalled.

   Or install the complete curated profile without prompts:

   ```bash
   agentic-install-skills-mcps --skill-profile default --yes
   ```

   This flag-only command uses all default skill targets and does not select MCP installation.

4. **Check installation and configuration.**

   ```bash
   agentic-stack-doctor
   agentic-skill-drift
   ```

   Doctor checks stack wiring; drift checks the manifest's full roster, not just the subset you selected. Deliberately omitted skills can therefore report `missing`. Inspect each drift column: `foreign:<source>` concerns recorded provenance, not necessarily different file contents; an upstream `unknown` is unverified, not a pass. Use `--no-upstream` for a separate source/install check if the upstream lookup is unavailable. Do not use `--update-baseline` merely to clear warnings.

5. **Start a new OMP session and check discovery.** Ask OMP to read `skill://<selected-name>` and report its name without executing the recipe. Check one selected skill from each installed pack; for Matt/pstack, `writing-for-agents` and `how` are examples if selected. Manual-only skills remain loadable by name even though OMP hides them from automatic discovery.

6. **Test workflows separately.** Successful installation and named loading do not prove end-to-end behavior. Exercise the chosen methods on bounded tasks and keep the actual evidence; do not treat doctor or a drift check as proof of a bug fix, downstream safety, or verifier coverage. See the [recorded verification scope](docs/skills-workflow-recheck-2026-09-21.md). To start work in a repository, follow the [pstack workflow](guides/poteto-workflow.md) and [skill routing](guides/skill-routing.md) guides.

#### Source drift

```bash
agentic-skill-drift                 # every pack; exits 1 on drift
agentic-skill-drift --pack ponytail --offline --no-upstream
agentic-skill-drift --update-baseline
```

Three columns per curated skill. **Source** compares the pack source with the reviewed fingerprint in [`skill-fingerprints.json`](agentic_env/skill-fingerprints.json) — a moved tag or an unreviewed vendored edit shows as `changed`. **Installed** compares `~/.agents/skills/<skill>` with that source and reports `missing`, `modified`, or `foreign:<source>` when the skills CLI lockfile names another origin. **Upstream** compares upstream at the pinned revision with upstream today, so a vendored pack's documented adaptations never register as drift while a real upstream edit does.

There is no `--skills-dir` override for this command: the Installed column always checks the canonical managed store. For either standalone-copy route, use [destination verification](#verify-and-refresh-standalone-copies) instead; a clean doctor or drift report does not validate those copies.

Pinned revisions come from the pack `source` for remote packs and the `upstream` block for vendored ones. Source trees are cached under `~/.cache/agentic-env/skill-sources`; `--offline` uses that cache only, `--no-upstream` skips the GitHub API. Record a reviewed state with `--update-baseline` after every deliberate pack move.

## Configuration and updates

- Existing managed MCP definitions and OMP settings are validated, not repaired. Correct reported fields manually; missing entries are added only to valid configuration.
- Hermes YAML writes keep a `.agentic-env.bak` backup but may discard comments/formatting. The configurator fails on Hermes drift even though doctor only warns.
- OMP gates `codebase-memory-mcp` and `node_repl`; `agentmemory` and `lean-ctx` stay excluded. Missing OMP settings are seeded only when the required checkout hooks exist. See [the contract](DECISIONS_AI_TOOLING.md).
- Reviewed versions in [stack metadata](agentic_env/stack_metadata.py) are floors. Install/update fetch the latest floating components and reject versions below the floor. Claude uses its `latest` channel.
- Hermes' installer and `codebase-memory-mcp` archives retain reviewed identities; remote scripts remain checksum-pinned. Skill packs move only by reviewed tags or vendored updates.
- Do not substitute `agentmemory upgrade`: it can invoke the `iii-engine` installer and modify the current workspace.

Check Hermes wiring with `hermes mcp list` and `hermes mcp test <server>`. Expected definitions are in [the configurator](agentic_env/configure_agent_mcps.py). To deliberately select its memory provider and add missing entries:

```bash
hermes config set memory.provider agentmemory
agentic-configure-agent-mcps --yes --server codebase-memory-mcp --server agentmemory --agent hermes
```

## Development

```bash
uv run --frozen python -m agentic_env.stack_doctor
uv run --frozen pytest -q
```

Other management checkout commands use `uv run --frozen python -m agentic_env.<module>`; installed commands use `agentic-*`. The dependency-free copier is the exception: run its package file directly with Python as shown above.

To run the portable copier checks without installing dependencies, from `agentic-env`:

```powershell
py -3 -S -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_copy_skills.py -v
```

Use `python3 -S -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_copy_skills.py -v` on macOS/Linux. These checks launch the real copier with site packages disabled and an empty `PATH`, using temporary destinations. The full suite includes Unix PTY tests and is not the Windows verification command.

## Clean-platform acceptance

Full-stack acceptance uses [the smoke script](docker-smoke-test.sh). [The isolation wrapper](clean-acceptance.sh) rejects root, the real HOME and nonempty fresh environments, clears inherited credentials/configuration, and uses checkout hooks. No provider credentials are required. Doctor's softer Hermes severity does not replace smoke's Hermes wiring checks. Windows has a separate copier-only check, described under [Development](#development), rather than this provisioning contract.

### Containers

Requires Docker/Compose with amd64 support. Run from this directory:

```bash
# Debian bookworm x86_64
docker compose up --build --force-recreate --exit-code-from fresh-install fresh-install
# Arch rolling x86_64
docker compose --profile arch up --build --force-recreate --exit-code-from fresh-install-arch fresh-install-arch
```

`--force-recreate` prevents reuse of a previous installation. To inspect and recheck one retained installation:

```bash
docker compose run --rm --entrypoint sh fresh-install
# Inside that container:
sh ./clean-acceptance.sh
SKIP_INSTALL=1 sh ./clean-acceptance.sh
```

Checks-only requires the same provisioned HOME; a newly recreated container is not valid checks-only evidence. Exiting the `--rm` container discards it. On an already-provisioned host, use `SKIP_INSTALL=1 sh ./docker-smoke-test.sh`.

`VERBOSE=1` streams each command instead of capturing it, which is how you see the skills phase: without it `run_cmd` prints output only when a command fails.

#### Driving the install by hand

To run the phases yourself rather than the scripted contract, keep a container alive and exec into it:

```bash
docker compose run -d --name agentic-manual --entrypoint sleep fresh-install infinity
docker exec -it agentic-manual bash
# inside:
export UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT=$HOME/.venv
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
uv tool install --force --python "$(uv python find 3.12)" .
agentic-install-skills-mcps --skill-profile default --yes
agentic-skill-drift --no-upstream
docker rm -f agentic-manual   # from the host, when finished
```

Three things differ from the scripted run, which provides them through `env -i`:

- **`UV_PROJECT_ENVIRONMENT` is required.** The repo mounts read-only, so `uv run` fails trying to write `.venv` inside it — and your host's `.venv` is visible through the mount, pointing at an interpreter that does not exist in the container.
- **Skill targets decide where skills land.** `--skill-agent claude` writes real directories under `~/.claude/skills` and never creates `~/.agents/skills`, so `agentic-skill-drift` reports the whole roster as `missing`. Omit the flag, or include `codex`, to populate the canonical store.
- **A clone failure surfaces as a false auth error.** `Failed to clone … Authentication failed` on a public repo means git mangled the ref advertisement (`expected flush after ref listing`); remote packs are cloned, so caveman absorbs it first. The image pins `http.version HTTP/1.1` for this; set the same in any other container.

### Native Apple Silicon

With Homebrew and working Command Line Tools:

```bash
test "$(uname -m)" = arm64
brew install uv python@3.12 node@20 xz ca-certificates
export AGENTIC_PREREQ_PATH="$(brew --prefix uv)/bin:$(brew --prefix python@3.12)/libexec/bin:$(brew --prefix node@20)/bin:$(brew --prefix xz)/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin"
export AGENTIC_SMOKE_HOME="$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/agentic-env-acceptance.XXXXXX")"
sh ./clean-acceptance.sh
SKIP_INSTALL=1 sh ./clean-acceptance.sh
```

Keep that HOME for inspection/rechecks; use a new empty directory for another fresh run. Intel macOS is out of scope. Arch is proxy evidence, not direct CachyOS verification.

### CI and recorded evidence

[CI](../.github/workflows/agentic-env-smoke-test.yml) gates native macOS arm64, Debian x86_64 and Arch x86_64 acceptance on unit tests. Each acceptance job runs fresh installation then checks-only. Linux checks-only also exercises updates; macOS skips that second update to avoid another unauthenticated GitHub lookup. [Run manually](https://github.com/MihaiA24/.dotfiles/actions/workflows/agentic-env-smoke-test.yml) when needed.

The independent **Windows Python-only skill copy** job uses `windows-latest` and Python 3.12 to run the dependency-free checks above. It covers complete vendored copies, reported remote exclusions, selection errors, collision preflight and refusal to copy into a source package. It does not install agents or MCPs or validate skill workflows.

On 2026-09-22, that [Windows job passed](https://github.com/MihaiA24/.dotfiles/actions/runs/35761661410/job/106860923046) at [`d9bff13`](https://github.com/MihaiA24/.dotfiles/commit/d9bff133715b6b3e063b705381c682bc52934d8e). This is copier acceptance, separate from the historical full-stack evidence below.

Historical [run 34526778331](https://github.com/MihaiA24/.dotfiles/actions/runs/34526778331), at [`2cb1f08`](https://github.com/MihaiA24/.dotfiles/commit/2cb1f08f9d0a7538ecef12e7532dfaee554a6400) on 2026-09-10, passed fresh and checks-only on:

| Environment | Architecture |
|---|---|
| Native macOS 15.7.9, build 24G830 | arm64 |
| Arch container, `VERSION_ID=20260906.0.587075` | x86_64 |
| Debian 12 bookworm container | x86_64 |

Linux used the Ubuntu host's `6.17.0-1022-azure` kernel: container-userland, not native distro-boot evidence. This historical run does not validate later changes. [Skill integration evidence](docs/skills-workflow-recheck-2026-09-21.md) is recorded separately.
